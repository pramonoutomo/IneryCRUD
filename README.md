# Prerequisites

To run these scripts, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```
you can check if the installation were succesfull using command:
```
node -v
```

You'll also need to install the dependencies required for these scripts. To do this, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project, then run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will install the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

You'll also need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain the following environment variables:
```
NODE_URL=<your_inery_node_address:port>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
INERY_ACCOUNT=<your_inery_account_name>
```
Replace the placeholders in angle brackets with the appropriate values for your setup.

This need your account to have deploy value contract on your account (use my example on https://docs.codeblocklabs.com/testnet/inery/value-contract if haven't check it yet)!
